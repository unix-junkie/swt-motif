/**
 * Instances of this class control the position and size of the 
 * children of a composite control by using <code>FormAttachments</code>
 * to optionally configure the left, top, right and bottom edge of
 * each child.
 * <p>
 * The following example code creates a <code>FormLayout</code> and then sets
 * it into a <code>Shell</code>:
 * <pre>
 * 		Display display = new Display ();
 *		Shell shell = new Shell(display);
 *		FormLayout layout = new FormLayout();
 *		layout.marginWidth = 3;
 *		layout.marginHeight = 3;
 *		shell.setLayout(layout);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use a <code>FormLayout</code>, create a <code>FormData</code> with
 * <code>FormAttachment</code> for each child of <code>Composite</code>.
 * The following example code attaches <code>button1</code> to the top
 * and left edge of the composite and <code>button2</code> to the right
 * edge of <code>button1</code> and the top and right edges of the
 * composite:
 * <pre>
 *		FormData data1 = new FormData();
 *		data1.left = new FormAttachment(0, 0);
 *		data1.top = new FormAttachment(0, 0);
 *		button1.setLayoutData(data1);
 *		FormData data2 = new FormData();
 *		data2.left = new FormAttachment(button1);
 *		data2.top = new FormAttachment(0, 0);
 *		data2.right = new FormAttachment(100, 0);
 *		button2.setLayoutData(data2);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each side of a child control can be attached to a position in the parent 
 * composite, or to other controls within the <code>Composite</code> by
 * creating instances of <code>FormAttachment</code> and setting them into
 * the top, bottom, left, and right fields of the child's <code>FormData</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a side is not given an attachment, it is defined as not being attached
 * to anything, causing the child to remain at it's preferred size.  If a child
 * is given no attachments on either the left or the right or top or bottom, it is
 * automatically attached to the left and top of the composite respectively.
 * The following code positions <code>button1</code> and <code>button2</code>
 * but relies on default attachments:
 * <pre>
 *		FormData data2 = new FormData();
 *		data2.left = new FormAttachment(button1);
 *		data2.right = new FormAttachment(100, 0);
 *		button2.setLayoutData(data2);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: Do not define circular attachments.  For example, do not attach
 * the right edge of <code>button1</code> to the left edge of <code>button2</code>
 * and then attach the left edge of <code>button2</code> to the right edge of
 * <code>button1</code>.  This will over constrain the layout, causing undefined
 * behavior.  The algorithm will terminate, but the results are undefined.
 * </p>

/**
 * Computes the preferred height of the form with
 * respect to the preferred height of the control.
 * 
 * Given that the equations for top (T) and bottom (B)
 * of the control in terms of the height of the form (X)
 * are:
 *		T = AX + B
 *		B = CX + D
 * 
 * The equation for the height of the control (H)
 * is bottom (B) minus top (T) or (H = B - T) or:
 * 
 *		H = (CX + D) - (AX + B)
 * 
 * Solving for (X), the height of the form, we get:
 * 
 *		X = (H + B - D) / (C - A)
 * 
 * When (A = C), (C - A = 0) and the equation has no
 * solution for X.  This is a special case meaning that
 * the control does not constrain the height of the
 * form.  In this case, we need to arbitrarily define
 * the height of the form (X):
 * 
 * Case 1: A = C, A = 0, C = 0
 *
 * 		Let X = D, the distance from the top of the form
 * 		to the bottom edge of the control.  In this case,
 * 		the control was attatched to the top of the form
 * 		and the form needs to be large enough to show the
 * 		bottom edge of the control.
 * 
 * Case 2: A = C, A = 1, C = 1
 * 
 * 		Let X = -B, the distance from the bottom of the
 *		form to the top edge of the control.  In this case,
 * 		the control was attached to the bottom of the form
 * 		and the only way that the control would be visible
 * 		is if the offset is negative.  If the offset is
 * 		positive, there is no possible height for the form
 * 		that will show the control as it will always be
 * 		below the bottom edge of the form.
 * 
 * Case 3: A = C, A != 0, C != 0 and A != 1, C != 0
 * 
 * 		Let X = D / (1 - C), the distance from the top of the 
 * 		form to the bottom edge of the control.  In this case, 
 * 		since C is not 0 or 1, it must be a fraction, U / V.  
 * 		The offset D is the distance from CX to the bottom edge 
 * 		of the control.  This represents a fraction of the form 
 * 		(1 - C)X. Since the height of a fraction of the form is 
 * 		known, the height of the entire form can be found by setting
 * 		(1 - C)X = D.  We solve this equation for X in terms of U 
 * 		and V, giving us X = (U * D) / (U - V). Similarily, if the 
 * 		offset D is	negative, the control is positioned above CX.
 * 		The offset -B is the distance from the top edge of the control
 * 		to CX. We can find the height of the entire form by setting 
 * 		CX = -B. Solving in terms of U and V gives us X = (-B * V) / U.
